# Screenshots

These screenshots showcase the impulse music player with a demo library of jazz standards.

## Demo Library

The screenshots feature a fake library of classic jazz standards performed by legendary artists including:
- Dave Brubeck
- Herbie Hancock
- Wayne Shorter
- Billie Holiday
- Miles Davis
- John Coltrane
- And many more...

The demo includes famous jazz standards such as:
- Take Five
- Round Midnight
- Stella by Starlight
- Autumn Leaves
- Blue in Green
- So What
- My Favorite Things
- And many others...

## How These Were Generated

The demo library and screenshots were created using automation scripts that:
1. Generated silent MP3 files with proper jazz metadata (artist, title, album, year)
2. Organized them in an artist/album folder structure
3. Captured the impulse UI displaying this library

This allows users to see the interface before trying the application with their own music collection.
